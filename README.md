# Assimp CLI Builds

Every week, you'll find up-to-date Windows and macOS binaries of the [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) CLI tool in the [Releases](https://github.com/SamuelTallet/Assimp-CLI-Weekly-Builds/releases) page of this repository.

But be aware: these binaries are built from the ever-changing Assimp repository `master` branch and thus they may be unstable.
