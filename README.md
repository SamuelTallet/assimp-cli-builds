# Assimp CLI Builds

Every week, unless build error, you'll find new binaries of the [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) CLI tool in the [Releases](https://github.com/SamuelTallet/Assimp-CLI-Weekly-Builds/releases) page of this repository, ready to be downloaded.

But be aware, these are built from the ever-changing Assimp's `master` branch and thus they may be unstable.
